Tidings is a special social media application that allows users to post and reply to public messages called tyds.

## How to get it running on your local machine
- Clone the repository to your desired location in your machine.
- Get a working database , preferably MySql and make chages in the *app.js* and *sqlqueries* to match you db.
- Install node dependencies by running `npm i` in a terminal with current directory being **tidings**. That is inside the cloned repository.
- Start the app by running `npm run dev` then navigate to you browser if your local server successfully starts up.
